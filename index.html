      My personal work in animations, colors, and drawing is incredibly
      important to me. At my desk… My latest personal project was inspired by
      the book: Logo Modernism, Jens Müller. This book is actually my husband’s
      book, but as it stands on my desk I got inspired by all the amazing and
      simple shapes it presents. I got the idea to choose the most interesting
      to me and create two simple words with it.
